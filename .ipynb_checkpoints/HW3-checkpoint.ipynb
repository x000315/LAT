       " ' a very important question for at least four reasons. First',\n",
       " ' a lot\\nof new educational methods are now widely canvassed in which the significance of teaching is far from clear. Repeatedly one finds an almost exclusive emphasis on certain activities of the pupils',\n",

       " ' some of them thought to be\\nmorally undesirable',\n",
       " ' whose relation to teaching is by no means clear:\\nactivities like indoctrinating',\n",

In\\nthe rest of this paper I am not concerned with the enterprise use of the\\nterm and would add only one point about it.

Why exactly is opening a window or sharpening a pencil\\nnot teaching? Manifestly teaching is no one specific activity readily\\nidentifiable in general circumstances like say walking or running or riding\\na bicycle. There are an enormous number of specific activities which may\\nin fact be teaching. One might be describing a historical situation and this\\nWHAT IS TEACHING?\\ncould be called teaching.

Hirst\\\\nProfessor of Education\\\\nKing\\\\\\'s College\\\\nUniversity of London\\\\nThe question with which this paper is concerned is simply \"What is\\\\nteaching?\". How do we distinguish teaching from other activities? This\\\\nis\\', \\' I think\\', \\' a very important question for at least four reasons. First\\', \\' a lot\\\\nof new educational methods are now widely canvassed in which the significance of teaching is far from clear. Repeatedly one finds an almost exclusive emphasis on certain activities of the pupils\\', \\' say those of enquiry\\', \\'\\\\ndiscovery and play\\', \\' not on the activities of the teacher. In the discussion\\\\nof such methods it seems to me there is much misunderstanding of what\\\\nteaching is and therefore of what it involves\\', \\' and this not infrequently\\\\nleads to a very distorted view of the whole educational situation. Secondly\\', \\'\\\\npeople are now aware of a range of activities\\', \\' some of them thought to be\\\\nmorally undesirable\\', \\' whose relation to teaching is by no means clear:\\\\nactivities like indoctrinating\\', \\' preaching\\', \\' advertising and propagandizing.\\\\nThere are many terms that are as it were in the same logical band as\\\\n\"teaching\"\\', \\' and we are I think rightly getting more sensitive as to whether\\\\nor not the activities these terms label ought to go on in school. If we can\\\\nget clearer about the nature of teaching it will surely help us to see the\\\\ncharacter of these other processes and their inter-connections. Similar\\\\nproblems are raised by the use of teaching machines and other devices\\', \\'\\\\nnot to mention sleep-teaching.\\\\nThirdly\\', \\' we are clearly in need of a great deal of carefully controlled\\\\nempirical research on the effectiveness of different teaching methods. But\\\\nwithout the clearest concept of what teaching is\\', \\' it is impossible to find\\\\nappropriate behavioural criteria whereby to assess what goes on in the\\\\nclassroom. Most teaching methods new and old are advocated or defended\\\\non little more than hunch or personal prejudice. What we need to know\\\\nare some relevant empirical facts\\', \\' but these we cannot find if we are uncertain how to identify cases of teaching anyway. And finally\\', \\' being clear\\\\nabout what teaching is\\', \\' matters vitally because how teachers understand\\\\nteaching very much affects what they actually do in the classroom. If it\\\\nis the case that our activities depend on how we ourselves see them\\', \\' what\\\\nwe believe about them\\', \\' then if we have crazy\\', \\' fuzzy ideas about teaching\\', \\'\\\\nwe will be likely to do crazy and f'"
